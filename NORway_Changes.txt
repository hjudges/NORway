NORway - Teensy++ 2.0 NOR flasher for PS3 (judges@eEcho.com)
------------------------------------------------------------

v0.1
----
+ Initial release

v0.2
----
+ 3.3V voltage regulator required!
+ Changed clock speed to 8MHz

v0.3
----
+ Speed optimizations

	Dumping now only takes 45 secs instead of over 5 mins!
	Writing now only takes about 8.5 mins instead of over 2 hours!

v0.4
----
+ Bugfix: RY/BY signal was not always detected correctly
+ Added programming support for Samsung and Macronix

	Currently supported NOR types:
	Spansion S29GL128N
	Spansion S29GL128P
	Samsung K8P2716UZC
	Samsung K8Q2815UQB
	Macronix MX29GL128E

+ Added manufacturer and chip type autoselect
+ Added sector protection recognition (not supported for Samsung K8Q2815UQB)
+ Added "bootloader" command to NORway.py (enters Teensy's bootloader mode)
+ Added "erasechip" command to NORway.py

	NORway.py COMx erasechip

	Erases the entire NOR (takes 1-3 minutes)

+ Added two new programming modes

	NORway.py COMx writeword dump.bin

		Requires manual chip/sector erase before.

		Programs the NOR in word programming mode. It's a four-bus-cycle
		operation (per word), i.e. it's the slowest, but most compatible
		programming mode. A full write takes about 9 minutes. Supported by
		all NOR types. Use this as a last resort if nothing else works.

	NORway.py COMx writewordubm dump.bin

		Requires manual chip/sector erase before.

		Programs the NOR in unlock bypass mode (word programming). It's a
		two-bus-cycle operation (per word), i.e. it's slower than write
		buffer programming (command "write"), but faster than standard word
		programming mode (see above). A full write takes about 9 minutes.
		Supported by all NOR types. Use this if "write" command doesn't work.

v0.5
----
+ Added block table for Samsung K8Q2815UQB. The programming modes "writeword" and
  "writewordubm" don't require manual chip/sector erase prior to writing anymore!
+ Bugfix: "NORway.py COMx release" didn't work. Now you can leave Teensy powered at
  all times and console will boot up correctly after issuing a "release" command
+ Bugfix: increased TRANSMIT_TIMEOUT for Teensy's serial device to 10000ms
  (required for OS X)
+ Bugfix: disabled DSR/DTR flow control (wasn't working reliably on OS X)
+ Bugfix: TRISTATE wasn't set correctly
+ Added additional verification when writing is done. Although each write command
  verifies each written sector/block, it happened that written bytes weren't
  persistent
+ Added "verify" command

v0.6
----
+ Changed programming modes "write", "writeword" and "writewordubm" to
  "vwrite", "vwriteword" and "vwritewordubm"
+ Added new programming modes that skip verification for single 4KB blocks:
  "write", "writeword" and "writewordubm"
  Since verification is done anyway at the end of programming, it's not
  necessarily required anymore to verify each single block individually.
+ Moved verification algorithm to Teensy. Saves serial communication
  overhead and gains another minute for writing modes "vwrite", "vwriteword"
  and "vwritewordubm"

v0.7
----
+ Bugfix: changed TRANSMIT_TIMEOUT for Teensy's serial device to 200ms

v0.8
----
+ Added light show for "sandungas" :P (connect a LED to pin B7)
